# Knight's Attack
Time to train your knights...

Consider an infinite chessboard... With obstacles on it... You're provided with a start point, an end point (as tuples (x,y)) and a tuple of all coordinates that are blocked by obstacles. Your goal is to find the number of minimal moves required to reach the destination, coming from the start.

If the destination isn't reachable, return None/nil.

## Details
A knight moves in an "L" shape: two positions in one direction, then one position in a perpendicular direction.
